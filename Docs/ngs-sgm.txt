see
code/ngs/morph_mesher/unit_tests/pgeom/ACISFixtures/
for an example of how to convert an acis pgeom into a step sgm
in the parent directory, there are examples of tests that use these geometries


# to bake ngs for the sgm tests
bake ngs -e debug

executable will end up someplace like this
/scratch/samitch/code/bin/linux-gcc-4.9.3-ip-openmpi-1.10.2/debug/morph_mesher


run morph_mesher_pgeom_utest
to just do your test, do
morph_mesher_pgeom_utest --gtest_filter=this.that
where in the test file it says
TEST(this,that)
see for example
code/ngs/morph_mesher/unit_tests/pgeom/ACISFixtures/UnitTestGeometryFixtures.cpp 

Matt suggested that to be a good test to start with
