# compute server
# ssh -Y cee-compute011
# samitch's blade
# ssh -Y ceerws1016.sandia.gov 

# decide where you want to put the source and compile
# scratch space is a reasonable option, but it will tie you to always building on that machine
# e.g. on a compute server, try /scratch/samitch, replacing samitch with your user name
